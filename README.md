## Inspiration
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning have always fascinated me because they represent the future of human innovation.  
The inspiration behind NeuroVerse came from the idea of creating something that not only solves problems but also adapts, learns, and improves continuously.

## How I Built It
I built NeuroVerse using Python for AI/ML models and TensorFlow for training.  
- React was used for the frontend interface.  
- Plotly & Matplotlib for data visualization.  
- APIs integrated for real-time data fetching.  
- GitHub for version control and collaboration.  

## Challenges I Ran Into
- Training large ML models with limited computing resources.  
- Optimizing accuracy without overfitting.  
- Debugging API integration issues.  
- Managing time effectively during the hackathon.  

## What I Learned
- How to optimize machine learning models for better accuracy.  
- The importance of designing user-friendly visualizations.  
- Practical skills in integrating multiple tools and APIs.  
- How to take an idea from concept to working prototype.  

## What's Next for NeuroVerse
- Expanding with deep learning.  
- Adding VR/AR integration.  
- Deploying as a cloud-based AI platform.
